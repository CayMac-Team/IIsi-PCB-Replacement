# IIsi-PCB-Replacement
Replacement PCB for the IIsi Power Supply

Here are all the files you need to order your own IIsi Power Supply replacement boards. There are
only 3 items you can have the PCB supplier add for you if you wish or buy them from a supplier
and solder them on yourself. These items are in the BOM and CPL file. I use JLCPCB for my orders

The Extra Parts Needed.txt file are the items I buy from mouser to finish the build. There are only
2 items from mouser needed for this board.

The other parts are the standoffs along with the nuts and the screws. I buy these in buld from Amazon.

The last 2 items are the PicoATX and the AC/DC converter and these are also from Amazon.

As of November 1, 2024 items are released under the Licensing: CC4.0-BY-NC-ND
